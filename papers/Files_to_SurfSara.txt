In order to get the data on surfsara you should first get the cookies.
-Make sure you are on the kaggle website and logged in.
-Then save the cookies as cookies.txt file.*Probably some add one needed if you don't already have one. Export cookies for Firefox* 

then open commandwindow and do the following:
pscp C:\path\to\the\file\cookies.txt lisab@cartesius.surfsara.nl: (change username to yours)
This will copy the cookies.txt in your machine to surfsara directory

Then to download the data from kaggle.com to the directory in surfsara, log in to surfsara and do the following:

wget --load-cookies cookies.txt https://www.kaggle.com/c/intel-mobileodt-cervical-cancer-screening/download/train.7z

Where the kaggle link is just the link for in this case the train set, but you should change it for every dataset you need to get on surfsara.
